# CDPlayer

 This class is a subclass of UIView and contains an AVPlayerLayer as a property, which it uses to display video content. It also has several blocks for handling different aspects of the video playback process, such as when the video finishes playing, when the video's status changes, and when its loaded time ranges change.

The class has various properties for controlling the playback, such as rate (for setting the playback rate), currentTime (for getting or setting the current playback time), maximumDuration (for getting the maximum duration of the current video), and isCanBackgroundPlay (for determining whether or not the video can continue to play in the background).

The class also has some other features such as support for picture-in-picture playback, and a fillMode property for setting the video's display mode. The CDPlayerView class is intended to be a versatile and customizable video player that can be used in a variety of applications.
